title: Homework 1 Needs

## Objectives 

   - Experiment with ACL2s, our substrate for exploring logic and computation 
   - Develop a familiarity and comfort with Eclipse and ACL2s
   - Discover similarities and differences with Racket 
   - Practice submitting ACL2 files on handins

# Preliminary note. 

Only create directories in workspace using ACL2s because `Eclipse` will
not recognize a project directory it did not create. Once you create a
project directory, you can add files to the directory from you OS
using the synced directory. Don't add files to the workspace directory
from your OS in any other way! Once you have added files (say homework
files you downloaded), then in eclipse, in the project explorer,
refresh the project and you will now see and will be able to access
the files you added.

# Getting Started with ACL2s

   1. Bookmark the [ACL2 documentation](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/?topic=ACL2____TOP) (NB. ACL2s is an easy front-end and setup for ACL2). Furthermore, [download a copy of the documentation](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/current/combined-manual/download/) to your development machine, and expand this archive in a convenient location. This will be convenient for you.
   2. Next, follow the `Get Set`, `Go`, and `Line action` sections of the [ACL2s tutorial](http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/doc/#tutorial)

      By the end of this tutorial you should feel comfortable moving around the Eclipse IDE and ACL2s interface. 

   3. In a file named ``, define the fibonacci function as your lab this week demonstrates. 
   
   4. Use ACL2s to define at least 3 other functions in that same file.



In particular, see the Get Set section on how to set up Eclipse.
ACL2s is built on top of ACL2, which has extensive documentation. I suggest that you download a local copy of the documentation. Save and expand the documentation file in a convenient location which will make looking up documentation easier.
Once you have ACL2s up and running, you should:
Use ACL2s to define some simple functions in ACL2s mode. Only use ACL2s mode.
Explore the ACL2s GUI and keyboard shortcuts.
Information on how to do all of this is available from the ACL2s Web page.

   To get the handin server sign-up information, you must have logged in to Piazza and visited our Piazza post.

## To get credit on the assignment, you must have submitted a screen-shot of:

   - Eclipse 
   - Open in VMWare 
   - With the ACL2 installation installed
   - the ACL2 preference pane (or w/e)
   - And the codeTogether plugin open
   - with your ccis username,
   - with your ccis github name
   - with your w/e else??
