CS 2800 Homework 2 - Spring 2020

 - Due on Tuesday, January 28 by 10:00 pm.

 - But you *must* have your team request made by midnight of Saturday, 
   January 25. (If you are already a member of a team from homework
   1, you're all set.)

 For this homework you will need to use ACL2s.

 Technical instructions:

 - Open this file in ACL2s as hwk02.lisp

 - Make sure you are in ACL2s mode. This is essential! Note that you can
   only change the mode when the session is not running, so set the correct
   mode before starting the session.

 - Insert your solutions into this file where indicated (usually as "...")

 - Only add to the file. Do not remove or comment out anything pre-existing.

 - Make sure the entire file is accepted by ACL2s. In particular, there must
   be no "..." left in the code. If you don't finish all problems, comment
   the unfinished ones out. Comments should also be used for any English
   text that you may add. This file already contains many comments, so you
   can see what the syntax is.

 - When done, save your file and submit it as hwk02.lisp

 - Do not submit the session file (which shows your interaction with the theorem
   prover). This is not part of your solution. Only submit the lisp file.

Instructions for programming problems:

For each function definition you must provide contracts, a body,
check= tests *and* test? forms (property-based testing).  For each
data definition you must provide check= tests *and* test?
forms (property-based testing).  This is in addition to the tests
sometimes provided. Make sure you produce sufficiently many new test
cases and at least two intersting test? forms.  

For function definitions, make sure to provide as many tests as the
data definitions dictate. For example, a function taking two lists
should have at least 4 tests: all combinations of each list being
empty and non-empty.  Beyond that, the number of tests should reflect
the difficulty of the function. For very simple ones, the above
coverage of the data definition cases may be sufficient. For complex
functions with numerical output, you want to test whether it produces
the correct output on a reasonable number of inputs.

Use good judgment. For unreasonably few test cases and properties we
will deduct points.

You can use any types, functions and macros listed on the ACL2s
Language Reference (from class Webpage, click on "Lectures and Notes"
and then on "ACL2s Language Reference").
