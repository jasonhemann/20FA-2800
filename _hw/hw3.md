ATTN: As a student pointed out in class, this file does not contain
the assignment itself. I have posted that on
[handins](https://handins.ccs.neu.edu/courses/108/assignments). It's
unfortunate you should have to look two places, so I will try to make
that the default location for HWs, and let you know.
