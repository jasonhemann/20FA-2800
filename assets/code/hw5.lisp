HW 5

This homework is a continuation of your assignment from lab. So,
please do start with that and then proceed apace.

|#


#|

NB. As with lab, we have deliberately removed our earlier allowances
that let us elide checking function and body contracts. We now know
what these are and understand them, so let's use this lab and HW to
get more comfortable.

|# 

(defdata
  (expr (oneof var
           rational
           (list 'quote expr)
           (list '* expr expr)
           (list 'let (list (list var expr)) expr))))

#| 

As discussed, our substitution into programs will only apply to free
variable occurrences. For a re-refresher see Ch 4. pp 76-77.

PART II: MORE EQUATIONAL REASONING

This too is a continuation from lab. Prove the following related
conjectures. That is, for each of the conjectures below:

1. Perform conjecture contract checking and add hypotheses if
   necessary. Contract completion is the process of adding the minimal
   set of hypotheses needed to guarantee that the input contracts for
   all functions used in the conjecture are satisfied. See the lecture
   notes. Do not add anything else to the conjecture.

2. Determine if the resulting conjecture is valid or not.  If it is
   valid, provide a proof, as outlined in the lecture notes and in
   class. If it is invalid, provide a counterexample. 

See your lab for more explicit instructions. Make sure to follow the
same instructions as in lab when giving proofs. We redefine below the
set of function definitions you can use.

Once again, I cannot /force/ you to, but you should absolutely use
ACL2s to check the conjectures you come up with, and you should use
the [automated proof checker](http://checker.atwalter.com/checker) to
check the proofs up with which you come. 

EDIT. You might /try/ it, but YMMV.

PART III: JUST FOR DESSERT

The below is for fun. You are not required to solve this problem. It
is here for those of you who want more. We shall not grade it.

(set-defunc-termination-strictp nil)

;; You will likely need to disable termination checking for this problem. 
;; Think about /why/, when you did not need to do so to solve the earlier problems.
;; For double fun bonus, ofc, try and do it /without/ disabling the termination !!

;; 6. Define and test a procedure var-occurs-bothp that takes a var
;; and an expr and returns t if that variable both occurs free in the
;; expression and occurs bound in the expression, and nil
;; otherwise. Do not change the method signature, but I created another help function. This
;; should not be implemented as two calls to your occurs-free and
;; occurs-bound functions or anything so simple. It ought to look
;; like a recursive function over the data structure, and I leave the structure of said data up to you.
