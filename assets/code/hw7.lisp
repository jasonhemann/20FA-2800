HW 7. More Admission and Definition

|#

#|

Once again, you are welcome to try these functions on ACL2s, but you cannot just
report what ACL2s reports to you. You have to provide your own arguments for
or against admissibility, as per instructions above.

For each definition below, check whether it is admissible, i.e., it
satisfies all conditions of the Definitional Principle. You can assume
that Condition 1 is met: the symbol used is a new function symbol.

A. If you claim that the function is admissible:

a) provide a measure function that can be used to prove termination

b) state the contract theorem (condition 5)

c) prove that the function is terminating using your measure function
   and equational reasoning

B. If you claim the function is not admissible, identify a condition 
   that is violated, subject to:

  - If conditions 2 or 3 are violated (formals are not distinct or
    body is not a term), explain the violation in English. 

  - If one of the other conditions is violated, provide an input that
    satisfies the input contract but causes the condition to
    fail. 
 
  - Even if multiple conditions are violated, you only have to find
    one such condition.

#| BONUS PROBLEM 

This is not a requirement, or for points. Instead, this is for dessert
and bragging rights.

But doable! If you attempt, I suggest 

a) reading to the end of this chapter and, 
b) testing only with small numbers!! 

(definec harvey (m :nat n :nat) :nat
  (cond
    ((zp n) 1)
    ((zp (1- m)) (* 2 n))
    (t (harvey (1- m) (harvey m (1- n)))))))

(definec h (n :nat) :nat
  (harvey n n))
