For obvious reasons, this semester we will hold office hours
remotely. Our TA staff will use the [WaitWhile queuing
system](https://app.waitwhile.com/checkin/280018279office), helping
students on a first-come, first-serve basis.

# Waiting Room / Study Hall

We will use the Microsoft Teams Team room for this class as a standing
["study hall" room](javascript:void(0)), and a waiting room where
students should virtually wait for our staff will go to find you when
it is your turn. If you can help another student without "giving away
the punchline" of a question or assignment, then that's a perfectly
reasonable thing to do. Helping someone else get unstuck is one of the
more productive things you can do while you are yourself stuck and
waiting for help!
