For obvious reasons, this semester we will hold office hours
remotely. Jason has linked his calendar so you can [book a 15 minute
appointment](javascript:void(0)) during his office hours. The other
staff will use the Waitwhile queuing system on a first-come,
first-serve basis. 

# Study Hall

We will maintain a standing ["study hall" room](javascript:void(0))
where students should virtually wait during office hours, where our
staff will go to find you when it is your turn. If you can help
another student without "giving away the punchline" of a question or
assignment, then that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Helping
someone else get unstuck is one of the more productive things you can
do while you are yourself stuck and waiting for help.
