# A Short History of Logic

# Propositional (Boolean) Logic 
## Why the name 'Propositional'?

Because it's a logic for reasoning about and around propositions:
wholly-formed units with meaning and whatever else. This kind of logic
lets us reason about the interrelationships between them. 

## What are the things we can talk about?

### valuation function.

### Separate the form of the argument from the truth or falsity of the underlying statements. 

```
The person who lives in the blue house lives next to the person who lives in the green house.
...
Therefor the person who lives in the red house owns the parrot. 
```

True or false. It sucks that we have to go and construct a mental
model of this, work through it, imagine, think about it at every
level. We have to think /semantically/, about the meanings of the
things that the argument discusses. 

Wouldn't it be cool, says Leibniz, if we could build a =ratiocenator=,
a calculating machine, that would just crank on, mechanically, that
would do the right things? 

Now, you all are cheating. You peeked ahead. You're in the future. 


## Boolean logic

"Honestly, kinda crappy at formalizing casual English arguments and
statements."

Right? 

But it's a beautiful, simplified model, and it works so
well. Sometimes, you can get so seduced by a beautiful model that you
form the complaint at reality that its insufficiently cleaned up to
match the model. 

However, this is really good. So, you have to understand where things
are #coming from# A \rightcup B

## (Not A) or B : The material conditional

Introduction to non-classical logics. 

### Falsifiable

### Satisfiable

### Unsatisfiable

### Valid

These are the cool ones. These are the forms of reasoning that in
various dimensions Greeks through Leibniz through Hilbert #were after#.

You plug in #any# propositions there, and it doesn't matter if they're
true or false, the general statement holds as true. Anywhere (within
the formal context of thinking and speaking clearly) we see this
structure, we know it works. And this is something we can look at.
