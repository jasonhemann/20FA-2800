# Project Proposal Grading Rubric

This is what I earnestly expect to use as my rubric to grade your
project proposals. This is of course not an iron-clad legally binding
contract, but my best effort, and so might require some
adjustments. Just as you all are submitting a way point and
iteratively developing and improving your project from there, this
rubric is a work-in-progress, and open to feedback. So as with other
parts of the course, pull requests are welcome.

## Preliminary Criteria

As preliminary criteria, I'm expecting something meeting basic,
prerequisite, base-line expectations. These include:

  - Be on topic
  - English.
  - Clear articulated research question.

## Actual Rubric

I have sub-divided this proposal in two parts, weighted roughly
equally. Each of these components is sub-divided under the following
five components. I am measuring each of those five components via
their self-evident description and the criteria outlined either in the
assignment description (those sub-questions) or the style and grammar
outline as linked to in the assignment description.
