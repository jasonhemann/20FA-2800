# Project Ideas

## Meet w/me if you have not.

  1. Japanese multiplication (https://vm.tiktok.com/J6j9TaW/)
  2. Russian peasant multiplication 
  3. McCarthy reverse? --- way too big & scary, IMHO
  4. Quines? How?
  5. STLC types? 
  6. Type checker? 
  7. Combinatory logic basis.
post-fix RPN calculations, well-formedness
