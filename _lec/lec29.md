# Other Project Ideas

  1. Japanese multiplication (https://vm.tiktok.com/J6j9TaW/)
  2. Russian peasant multiplication 
  3. McCarthy reverse? --- way too big & scary, IMHO
  4. Quines? How?
  5. STLC types? 
  6. Type checker? 
  7. Combinatory logic basis.
  8. Lam-calc to deBruijn indices?
  9. DeBruijn `add1`, or that a closed `lambda` calc expr generates a closed DeBruijn index term.
  10. `(implies (sorted-tree tree) (sorted-listp (preorder-walk tree)))`
  11. Comparing two different definitions of `zip-lists` recursive and not.
