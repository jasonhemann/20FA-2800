# Where we last left. 

## Proofs

Important to have a standardized format. 

### Machine checkable.

### Which is great! Definition of substitution wrong, for about ~20yrs

Hilbert, Ackermann... etc.  (cf. Hilbert-Ackermann "... Logic ..." book)

## Substitution. 

Important operation. Critical to what we have done and will do

## HW: Examples of such proofs.

# We had a more powerful technique. Program /equivalences/ rather than just boolean expressions. 

# Booleans, we had counterexamples. So far our claims that we've seen also give us some counterexamples. 

|                 | Booleans      | Expressions          |
| Counterexamples | Generated     | Can test if supplied |
| Power           | Lesser        | Greater              |
| Decidable?      | Yes           | No                   |
| Proofs in       | Trivially yes | Can be verified      |

## With greater power comes fewer freebies.
