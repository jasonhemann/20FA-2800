## It gets worse! 

   Rice's theorem:
   
   Decision problem for any non-trivial extensional property of Turing
   machines is undecidable.
   
   It states that for any non-trivial property, there is no general
    decision procedure that, for all programs, decides whether the
    partial function implemented by the input program has that
    property.
