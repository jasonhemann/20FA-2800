title: Where can I improve my (technical) writing products?
---

I love this question in part because Northeastern offers a *terrific*
answer! The Northeastern Writing Center offers a [whole *bevy* of
resources](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/writingcenter/writing-resources/),
including some of them tailored *specifically* for writing in STEM fields. 

They actually offer
[appointments](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/writingcenter/tutoring/online-appointments/),
[online](https://neu.mywconline.com/), where a writing specialist will
go over your work with you, and help suggest changes and directions
for improvement. You can do this from the comfort of your pyjamas!

How great is that!?
