Welcome to the "Logic and Computation" for Fall 2020. We hope this
will be an education and enjoyable experience. We endeavor to
spotlight the logical underpinnings of skills you have previously
learned, and also to contextualize the deep connections between
mathematical logic and computation.

combined our lab sections with Prof. Tripakis's. We will ask you to
