# Project Grading Rubric

This is what I earnestly expect to use as my rubric to grade your
projects. Once again, this is of course not an iron-clad legally
binding contract, but my best effort, and so might require some
adjustments. As with other parts of the course, pull requests are
welcome. Like I assess your work and offer suggestions, corrections,
and improvements, your feedback is valuable and you have unique
perspectives to offer. Some students have different or difficult

## Preliminary Criteria

I will look further and grade closer something meeting basic,
prerequisite, base-line minimum-specification expectations. These
include:

  - Be on topic.
  - Your group will schedule and present your question, research, and solution
  - You offer a demonstrable, excutable solution.
  - You provide an accompanying report/document
  - Clear articulates and addresses the research question to which we agreed
  - Prose in English.
  - Your report provides me a working link to your source code


## Actual Rubric

I have sub-divided this in four parts, weighted roughly
as follows: 

  - Report Content:             30%
  - Software:                   30%
  - Report Style/Writing:       25%
  - Presentation/Demonstration: 15%

Each of these components is sub-divided into the following
components. I am measuring each of those sub-areas via their
self-evident description and the criteria outlined in the following
sections and the style and grammar outline as linked to in the project
proposal description.

## Software Criteria

 I outline below the criteria I intend to use to assess each of the above-mentioned aspects of your software.

### Source 

   - Repo, directories, files, modules, classes, etc are well-organized and logically structured
   - Transparently states required packages/dependencies and how to install them
   - Source directory includes test data 
   - Source code is reasonably well-written 
   - Comprehensible error messages correctly report errors or bad data.

### Well-written documentation, including:

   - Classes and methods have signatures and purpose statements
   - Data descriptions that express well-formed and valid inputs
   - Comments sufficient to clarify difficult/unique/opaque portions
   - A repo-level README w/setup instructions
   - Diagrams of program's overall organization, structure or data flow

### Tests

   - Tests program's full input/output behavior
   - Tests help methods 
   - Preliminary tests demonstrate simple examples
   - Comprehensive tests exhibit program's completeness viz. research question
   - Some independent verification shows program's correctness 

### Incidental code quality
  
    This is deliberately vague, and intended to catch some issues not
    otherwise mentioned. These can include non-critical bugs or
    inefficiencies, missing edge cases, and inadequate/inappropriate
    use of libraries.
   
## Presentation/Demonstration

 I outline below the criteria I intend to use to assess each of the above-mentioned aspects of your presentation/demonstration.

### Organization

  - Clear, engaging introduction body and conclusion
  - Recapitulate the problem area
  - Logical progression of ideas
  - Smooth transitions to different parts

### Depth/Emphasis

  - Situates your precise problem in context
  - Maintains focus on your work and contribution
  - Explanations have appropriate level of detail
  - Devotes ample time for demonstration

### Program Demonstration

  - Demonstrate an executable solution 
  - Explain *how* this demonstrates the solution
  - Walk an audience through 
  - Answer questions about research and result

### Style

  - Professional demeanor
  - Clear and articulate delivery
  - Adequate vocabulary and nomenclature

### Teamwork

  - Group coordinates to suggest and schedule a 25m block w/Jason
  - All members of the group can demonstrate mastery of the results
  - Group members can trade off with one another

## Report Content
  
  TBD, atm. Largely the same as the proposal, with better verb tenses. TBD.
