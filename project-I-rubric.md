# Project Grading Rubric

This is what I earnestly expect to use as my rubric to grade your
projects. Once again, this is of course not an iron-clad legally
binding contract, but my best effort, and so might require some
adjustments. As with other parts of the course, pull requests are
welcome. Like I assess your work and offer suggestions, corrections,
and improvements, your feedback is valuable and you have unique
perspectives to offer. Some students have different or difficult to
characterize projects. If this format is a poor fit to your project,
please let me know and we can discuss how to adjust your submission.

## Preliminary Criteria

I will look further and grade closer something meeting basic,
prerequisite, base-line minimum-specification expectations. These
include:

  - Be on topic.
  - Your group will schedule and present your question, research, and solution
  - You offer a demonstrable, excutable solution.
  - You provide an accompanying report/document
  - Clear articulates and addresses the research question to which we agreed
  - Prose in English.
  - Your report provides me a working link to your source code


## Actual Rubric

I have sub-divided this in four parts, weighted roughly
as follows: 

  - Report Content:             30%
  - Software:                   30%
  - Report Style/Writing:       25%
  - Presentation/Demonstration: 15%

Each of these components is sub-divided into the following
components. I am measuring each of those sub-areas via their
self-evident description and the criteria outlined in the following
sections and the style and grammar outline as linked to in the project
proposal description.

## Report Content

Assuming decent, standard font and margin sizes, I imagine that an
adequate accompanying report will be about six pages, excluding
references and any appendices. I would worry if it seems like you can
set everything forth in under four pages, and I would also worry if
you start going beyond ten. These are rough, approximate guidelines,
please do not feel compelled to play the font family/size/margin game
to hit an upper or lower limit. The following is a brief template you
might consider:

### General problem area
  - Clear, engaging introduction that narrows in focus as it proceeds 
  - Contextualizes the problem within the related (narrowly construed) research area
### Approach
  - Discusses and compares (related/the same) solutions to (the same/related) problems.
  - Unambiguously demarcate the novel part of your work.
  - Restate here the predefined metric for success (either from your proposal or meeting w/me)
### Methodology 
  - What specific steps did you take?
  - Which of these steps proved particularly hard?
  - Which of these steps were unexpectedly hard or intriguing?
### Results
  - Did you succeed by your own metric for success?
  - Provide supporting evidence and clear reasoning for the preceding.*
  - How well/how far do your results generalize?
  - What lingering, niggling doubts make you qualify your achievement?
### Summary
  - What did we (civilization) learn from you accomplishing this project?
  - What related still-open research problems/issues remain are now within easier reach?

* If you did not achieve the intended results, see me. It's better
  than weasel-wording around it.


## Software Criteria

 I outline below the criteria I intend to use to assess each of the above-mentioned aspects of your software. 

### Source 

   - Repo, directories, files, modules, classes, etc are well-organized and logically structured
   - Transparently states required packages/dependencies and how to install them
   - Source directory includes test data 
   - Source code is reasonably well-written 
   - Comprehensible error messages correctly report errors or bad data.

### Well-written documentation, including:

   - Classes and methods have signatures and purpose statements
   - Data descriptions that express well-formed and valid inputs
   - Comments sufficient to clarify difficult/unique/opaque portions
   - A repo-level README w/setup instructions
   - Diagrams of program's overall organization, structure or data flow

### Tests

   - Tests program's full input/output behavior
   - Tests help methods 
   - Preliminary tests demonstrate simple examples
   - Comprehensive tests exhibit program's completeness viz. research question
   - Some independent verification shows program's correctness 

### Incidental code quality
  
    This is deliberately vague, and intended to catch some issues not
    otherwise mentioned. These can include non-critical bugs or
    inefficiencies, missing edge cases, and inadequate/inappropriate
    use of libraries.
   
## Presentation/Demonstration

 I outline below the criteria I intend to use to assess each of the above-mentioned aspects of your presentation/demonstration.

### Organization

  - Clear, engaging introduction body and conclusion
  - Recapitulate the problem area
  - Logical progression of ideas
  - Smooth transitions to different parts

### Depth/Emphasis

  - Situates your precise problem in context
  - Maintains focus on your work and contribution
  - Explanations have appropriate level of detail
  - Devotes ample time for demonstration

### Program Demonstration

  - Demonstrate an executable solution 
  - Explain *how* this demonstrates the solution
  - Walk an audience through how your solution works internally
  - Answer audience questions about research and result

### Style

  - Professional demeanor
  - Clear and articulate delivery
  - Adequate vocabulary and nomenclature

### Teamwork

  - Group coordinates to suggest and schedule a 25m block w/Jason
  - Group members can trade off with one another
  - All members of the group can demonstrate mastery of the results
