Course syllabus and policies.

** Grade Breakdown

   I will assess course grades as follows: 

      | Category         | Weight |
      |------------------+--------|
      | Participation    |     5% |
      | Homework*        |    20% |
      | Quizzes          |    10% |
      | Attendance (Lab) |    20% |
      | Final Project    |    20% |

** Technology and Platforms

As a course and a student body, we are more remote than usual, and
preferable. To help bridge the chasm, I will leverage some of the
technology platforms Northeastern makes available to us.
