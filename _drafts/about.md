## About Your Instructor: 

   - Jason Hemann
   - Doctorate in Computer Science, Indiana University
   - Concentration in Logic
   - Philosophy undergraduate
   - Dance and run and talk software and how it helps people

## What is this class about, and why? 

   - Computation: Writing Programs
   - Logic: Writing Properties *about* programs, and proving them. 
   
## Computer Science is about many things

   - Many practitioners don't know or think about them. 
   - c.f. Socratic dialogues, art, honor, justice
   - Philosophy of Science is not a science.

## Is computer science a science? 

   - 
   
## Is computer science an engineering discipline? 

## What is an algorithm? alg v. program?

## Exercise: Computer software: patentable?

## What are some things that computer science is about:

   - "The science of computers"? 
   - Computationally inspired mathematics? 
   - 

## Does an algorithm exist in absence of a purpose? 

## Do we need a study of the properties of programs

## What assurances can we have about our computer programs? 
  
  
Therac-25
Intel FDIV “Pentium Bug”
Knight Capital 
Mariner 1
Stanislav Petrov and SAD
Mars Climate Orbiter
Ariane 5 Flight 501
Boeing 737 Max
Uber Self-driving Cars
Panama Cancer Institute
2003 North American Blackout
KAL Flight 801
ILOVEYOU virus
Toyota Acceleration Recalls

Knight capital lost half a billion dollars in ~30m b/c a software bug allowed a computer system to trade w/o human intervention
National cancer institute: years after Therac-25, *another* computer system kills via radiation
WWIII was *this* close, averted by human intervention, but software bug. 
94, 8-state + canada blackout attributed to a race condition.

## How do we design software?? 
   - Trial and error
   
   
   - Model based design
   
   build model
   simulate 
   
   
▶ Goal in a nutshell: In Fundies 1 you learned how to program. In 2800 you will learn how to reason about your programs (make predictions).
▶ Focus on the fundamentals:
▶ Programming language syntax
▶ Programming language semantics: what the program
means
▶ Specification: making clear, unambiguous statements
about our programs
▶ Tests: testing those statements automatically
▶ Proofs: proving those statements
▶ Hands-on experience using ACL2s.
▶ Material accessible to 1st year undergrads.
▶ Logic: the language and methods to reason about our
programs
▶ Language to write specifications
▶ Language and methods to do the proofs
............... . ....
  ▶ Logic presented from a computational perspective
................. ...Course overview: rough list of topics
▶ contracts ▶ invariants ▶ properties ▶ testing
▶ propositional logic
▶ equational reasoning
▶ recursion and induction ▶ termination analysis
▶ various proof techniques ▶ software verification
