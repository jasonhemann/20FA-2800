## Collaborative Course Construction and Feedback 

We are together in unprecedented times. The typical course structure
implicitly assumes regular whole-class in-person meetings. We will not
have that this semester. No student will be physically present in
class on all days. Some students may not be physically present in
class at all, or on campus period. This change affects much of the
course infrastructure. As such, I *want* you all's feedback and
input. I am open to suggestions and changes; I consider this
preliminary until the end of the first week of class. You can see any
and all changes on the course website's repository. 

I cannot promise that we will act on all suggestions, and even those
we find compelling may not be implementable as we go. 

# Purpose and Objectives

CS 2800 will introduce you to formal logic and its deep connections to
computing. The goal of the course is to introduce fundamental,
foundational methods for modeling, designing and reasoning about
computation. This course considers approaches to proving programs
properties including termination, correctness, and safety. The course
also introduces students to modeling with logic the range of artifacts
and phenomena that arise in computer and information science.

After this course you will know how to:

  1. translate statements about programs' behavior into logical claims
  2. prove such claims both by hand and via automated tools.

After this course you will appreciate the benefits thinking logically
when developing software, as well as the benefit of formal tools for
ensuring software correctness. You will also familiarize yourself with

  - propositional and first order predicate logic
  - logical inference
  - mathematical and structural induction
  - recursion 
  - equational reasoning,
  - rewriting, and 
  - various proof techniques

as well as the common notations for the preceding. We will study logic
from a computational perspective using the [ACL2 Sedan theorem proving
system](http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/doc). **Please do not use the
installation instructions on the this website. Instead follow the
first lab assignment.**

# Contact

The best way to get in contact for personal, private (FERPA, etc)
messages is via my email address
[jhemann@northeastern.edu](mailto:jhemann@northeastern.edu). You
should expect a response within 48 hours. You will find that I am
faster with [Piazza](Piazza) or our public forums. If I deem it even
potentially useful to others, I will likely anonymize your letter,
re-post it on Piazza, answer it there, and forward you the link.

A great regular way to reach out for help is via our [office
hours](javascript:void(0)).

# Final Exam

We will not have a final exam. Instead, our course will have a final
project component. During finals week, we will schedule slots for
students to present their final projects.

# Grade Breakdown

I will assign overall course grades as follows:

     | Category                  | Weight (%) |
     |---------------------------+------------|
     | Lecture, Quizzes          |         10 |
     | Homework                  |         30 |
     | Lab                       |         10 |
	 | 1st Project Proposal      |         10 |
	 | 1st Project               |         10 |
     | Final Project Proposal    |         10 |
     | Final Project             |         20 |
     | Total                     |        100 |

We (I) will calculate overall numeric grade according to this grading
scheme. Your final grades will be at least as good as the standard
calculation for As, Bs, Cs, etc. To assign final letter grades at the
end of the term I sum and chart the numeric scores, and break
students' grades where we see inflection points (with no students'
grade worse than their raw calculation). This means I *cannot* give
you a more precise estimate of your grade than what you calculate from
the raw score.

I will base some portions of your lab, homework, and lecture quiz
grades on completion and submission of the relevant exercises. I will
base the remaining portion of each on correctness. 

## Total Running Grade Calculation

We will track the completion portions of your lab and homework grades,
as well as your project grades, in handins. We will maintain a record
of the remaining grades, and will update you with the *current* status
of that before the drop deadline. Please ignore the grade tracker on
Canvas. We cannot give you a standing completion percentage of your
quizzes and correctness grades because, logically, there [are no pop
quizzes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexpected_hanging_paradox).

<!-- ## Alternate/Additional Assignment/Project Option -->

<!-- Throughout the semester there may be multiple opportunities for extra -->
<!-- credit. I want to give students an opportunity to demonstrate mastery -->
<!-- of the material in a way that resonates with you. If you feel like you -->
<!-- need or want more, or that your current assessments haven't -->
<!-- sufficiently demonstrated your understanding, please speak with -->
<!-- me. Under many exceptional circumstances we can come up with -->
<!-- additional or side-projects for the students to demonstrate mastery of -->
<!-- the material in class and then some. *Warning:* these will likely be -->
<!-- larger term assignments and you should not consider this an even -->
<!-- substitute. Certainly not the easy way to receive full marks. But a -->
<!-- way to redistribute some portion of the grade.  -->

# Attendance 

I expect you to attend lecture and lab each class period. Your
attendance is a prerequisite for a substantial portion of the course's
grade. We will not take attendance as such, but the following proxies
serve as an attendance grade.

## Reading, Content Quizzes

Before class, I will expect you to have read the notes as marked on
the schedule. There may be quick pop quizzes during the session. These
act as a forcing function for the lecture notes and alert me to
students' difficulties. Sometimes we take these for completion, others
for accuracy. These grade belongs under "Lecture Quizzes."

## Homework Submissions

Unless otherwise indicated, homework submissions are due by 10pm on
the Monday after I have assigned them. To universally, uniformly and
preemptively account for any number of situations that arise, I will
drop every student's lowest homework assignment grade. This absolution
for one assignment is our late/etc homework clemency; I **shall not**
accept late homework otherwise; we are, however happy to go over your
submissions with you at office hours.

## Oral Homework Explanations

Proof has a social component. As such, part of your homework grade
will also include your ability to communicate the meaning of your
proof to your colleagues. You will be randomly selected from the class
roster to walk us all through some answer of yours. Being absent from
class means you cannot participate. Not all homework questions will
get an oral explanation, others we will take for completion or grade
ourselves for accuracy. Regardless these grade belongs under
"Homework" as well.

# Recent Changes

This semester we will leverage more project-based assignments,
including individually or group-selected proofs for topics that have
come up in practice. Students will complete two of these, a small one
and a big one. The former also serves as practice for the latter.

I'm also planning to use some of the last part of the course, while
students are working on these larger projects, to talk about
computational logic in a different context: logic programming. We can
also get into the "guts" of an implementation of such a system, where
ACL2, ACL2s is so much more sophisticated that it's tough for students
to wrap their heads around an implementation.

If in fact you're interested in PL research, logic, logic program,
automated theorem proving or the like, please let me know on that too!
I'm excited to talk more about it all :-)

# Projects 

We have two projects in this course. Together with your partner, you
should start thinking about something worth proving. These might come
from Fundies I, Fundies II, from your math classes, or somewhere else
from your own experience. These should be large enough to be of
interest and challenging. The proof should be in some way
enlightening.

# Academic Integrity Policy

Students of course play an integral part in ensuring they receive the
full benefit of their coursework. The students of 2800 are certainly
beholden to the academic integrity policies of [Northeastern
University](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/),
the [Khoury
College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/information-for-overview/current-undergrad/undergraduate-advising-academic-support/academic-policies/).

## Teamwork and Collaboration

Pair programming is a central part of the undergraduate curriculum
here. Pair programming is not intended to divide-and-conquer, but
instead for students to collaboratively solve problems together. You
are only twice as fast working separately if the typing is by and away
the hardest part of programming. Which it is not.

Ultimately, you should be responsible for and have a firm
understanding of all work submitted under your name. You should be
able to demonstrate this mastery when requested. 

# Required Texts 

There are no required texts for this course. Our course will follow a
draft of [Pete Manolios's](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/~pete/) [/Reasoning
About Programs/ (2020)](/jhemann/2800/readings/). You will find these
notes linked from this website. I invite you to collaboratively
annotate these notes with me, and with each other.

# Academic Accommodations 

If you have accommodations from the [Disability Resource Center
(DRC)](http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/) please submit your Professor
Notification Letter to me by email, preferably within the first two
weeks of the quarter, so I can do my part to help you achieve equal
access in this course. I am eager to discuss ways we can ensure your
full participation.

I encourage all students who may benefit from learning more about DRC
services to [contact the
DRC](http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/#fp-blog-entry:~:text=Contact%20Information).

# Technology and Platforms

As a course and a student body, we are more remote than usual, and
preferable. We will leverage a number of Northeastern's technology
platforms to help bridge the chasm. Your first lab assignment will
walk you through installing and configuring these.

We will use a variety of tools and platforms to facilitate teaching
and learning at a somewhat remote distance and to compensate for this
unconventional semester. These include ACL2s, Eclipse, VirtualBox,
CodeTogether, WaitWhile, PollEverywhere, and Hypothes.is. Please see
the technology page for more details.

# Health and Safety

The university has put into place a robust plan to make the campus
healthy and safe for all — but you must do your part. On August 22, all
students received an
[email](https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/university-messages/university-response-to-unsafe-behavior/)
from Senior Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Madeleine Estabrook on
the expectations for behavior both on campus and off campus. **Please
read it carefully today.**

To summarize:

* Gatherings on or off campus must conform to healthy practices as
  outlined by university and [Massachusetts state
  guidance](https://www.mass.gov/doc/revised-gatherings-order-august-7-2020).
  If you host or attend an inappropriate party or gathering, you run the
  very real risk of immediate removal from the community.

* Wear a mask indoors and outdoors as you maintain a 6-foot distance
  from everyone.

* Get tested every three days using the COVID-19 Test Scheduler
  ([covid19-testing.northeastern.edu](https://northeastern.sharepoint.com/sites/covidscheduler).)
  We may require more frequent testing as the semester progresses. It’s
  quick, easy and will help us to quickly identify and care for anyone
  who tests positive. I will not be told the identity of anyone who
  tests positive, and you do not need to share that information with me
  or anyone else unless you want to. If you receive a positive test
  result, you will be contacted by a member of the university’s
  telehealth team who will provide you with next steps.

* Do a Daily Wellness Check
  ([wellness-check.northeastern.edu](https://wellness-check.northeastern.edu)),
  wash your hands well and regularly, and disinfect high-touch surfaces
  and spaces.

* I will be wearing a [face
  covering](https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/reopening/frequently-asked-questions/#reopening)
  or mask as I teach and expect that you will do the same in class. If
  you come to class without a mask, I’ll ask you to go and [get one on
  campus](https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/reopening/policies-and-protocols/#face-covering-protocol).
  You can get a mask at the Visitor Center or at the Curry Student
  Center Help Desk. If you refuse to wear a mask in class, I won’t be
  able to continue the class. If you are not sitting six feet apart from
  your classmate, I’ll ask you to do so. We won’t be able to eat or
  drink in class (except water). If you test positive, you will need to
  enter isolation as directed by the university’s telehealth team. I
  expect that you will not come in-person to class and that you will
  follow the guidance from the university telehealth team to isolate and
  get appropriate healthcare if needed.

* Staying safe is a responsibility that we all must take seriously.
  Keep in mind the “Protect the Pack” theme. Remember that our
  individual actions will help everyone stay safe this fall."
