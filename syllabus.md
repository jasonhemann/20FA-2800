CS 2800 will introduce you to formal logic and its deep connections to
computing. The goal of the course is to introduce fundamental,
foundational methods for modeling, designing and reasoning about
computation. This course considers approaches to proving programs
properties including termination, correctness, and safety. The course
also introduces students to modeling with logic the range of artifacts
and phenomena that arise in computer and information science.

After this course you will know how to:

  1. translate statements about programs' behavior into logical claims
  2. prove such claims both by hand and via automated tools.

After this course you will appreciate the benefits thinking logically
when developing software, as well as the benefit of formal tools for
ensuring software correctness. You will also familiarize yourself with

  - propositional and first order predicate logic
  - logical inference
  - mathematical and structural induction
  - recursion 
  - equational reasoning,
  - rewriting, and 
  - various proof techniques

as well as the common notations for the preceding. We will study logic
from a computational perspective using the [ACL2 Sedan theorem proving
system](javascript:void(0)).

This semester we will leverage more project-based assignments,
including individually or group-selected proofs for things that have
come up in practice. Students will complete two of these, a small one
and a big one. The former also serves as practice for the latter.

I'm also planning to use some of the last part of the course, while
students are working on these larger projects, to talk about
computational logic in a different context: logic programming. We can
also get into the "guts" of an implementation of such a system, where
ACL2, ACL2s is so much more sophisticated that it's tough for students
to wrap their heads around an implementation.

If in fact you're interested in PL research, logic, logic program,
automated theorem proving or the like, please let me know on that too!
I'd be excited to talk more about it all :-)

We are together in unprecedented times. The typical course structure
implicitly assumes regular whole-class in-person meetings. We will not
have that this semester. No student will be physically present in
class on all days. Some students may not be physically present in
class at all, or on campus period. This change affects much of the
course infrastructure. As such, I *want* you all's feedback and
input. I am open to suggestions and changes; I consider this
preliminary until the end of the first week of class. You can see any
and all changes on the course website's repository.

As a course and a student body, we are more remote than usual, and
preferable. We will leverage a number of Northeastern's technology
platforms to help bridge the chasm. 

# Contact

The best way to get in contact for personal, private (FERPA, etc)
messages is via my email address [jhemann@northeastern.edu](mailto:jhemann@northeastern.edu). You
should expect a response within 48 hours. You will find that I am
faster with [Piazza](Piazza) or our public forums. If I deem it even potentially
useful to others, I will likely anonymize your letter, re-post it on
Piazza, answer it there, and forward you the link.

# Grade Breakdown

  I will assign overall course grades as follows:

     | Category            | Weight (%) |
     |---------------------+------------|
     | Participation       |         10 |
     | Homework*           |         20 |
     | Quizzes             |         10 |
     | Attendance (Lab)    |         20 |
     | Final Project       |         20 |
     | Project Proposal    |         10 |
     | Warm-up Assignments |         10 |
     | Total               |        100 |
     #+TBLFM: @>$2=vsum(@2..@-1)

We (I) will calculate overall numeric grade according to this grading
scheme. Your final grades will be at least as good as the standard
calculation for As, Bs, Cs, etc. To assign final letter grades I sum
and chart the numeric scores, and break students' grades where we see
inflection points (with no students' grade worse than their raw
calculation). This means I *cannot* give you a more precise estimate
of your grade than what you calculate from the raw score.

## Total Running Grade Calculation

I will track your overall grade in the course thus far in Canvas. We
will not use it otherwise. Please ignore the grade tracker on handins
server; this is inaccurate.

## Alternate/Additional Assignment/Project Option

Throughout the semester there may be multiple opportunities for extra
credit. I want to give students an opportunity to demonstrate mastery
of the material in a way that resonates with you. If you feel like you
need or want more, or that your current assessments haven't
sufficiently demonstrated your understanding, please speak with
me. Under many exceptional circumstances we can come up with
additional or side-projects for the students to demonstrate mastery of
the material in class and then some. *Warning:* these will likely be
larger term assignments and you should not consider this an even
substitute. Certainly not the easy way to receive full marks. But a
way to redistribute some portion of the grade. 

# Attendance 

I will expect you to be in class each day. These will be homework
grades. Something worth proving in each of the sizes (normally they
would have to come up with a final / early submission)

Expect you to read (to have read) the notes. There will be a quick pop
quiz during the session. These will not be "cold calls", but you will
be randomly selected from the class roster to walk us all through some
answer of yours. 

# Academic Integrity Policy

We are certainly beholden to the academic integrity policies of 
Northeastern, the Khoury College, and the Department of Computer
Science. 

So, here's what I can do. Here's what I can't do. This is for your own
good. I can do my best to incentivize the good behavior. I can't
enforce it. You all can. 

# Required Texts 

There are no required texts for this course. Our course will follow a
draft of [Manolios's /Reasoning About Programs/ (2020)](javascript:void(0)). You will find
these notes linked from the [Notes] page on this website. I invite you
to collaboratively annotate these notes with me, and with each other.

# Academic Accommodations 

If you have accommodations from the [Disability Resource Center (DRC)](http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/)
please submit your Professor Notification Letter to me by email,
preferably within the first two weeks of the quarter, so I can do my
part to help you achieve equal access in this course. I am eager to
discuss ways we can ensure your full participation.

I encourage all students who may benefit from learning more about DRC
services to [contact the DRC](http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/#fp-blog-entry:~:text=Contact%20Information).


# Technology and Platforms

We will use a variety of tools and platforms to facilitate teaching
and learning at a somewhat remote distance and to compensate for this
unconventional semester. Please see the [technology page]({% link tech.md | relative_url %}) for
more details.
